 MNG_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Minas Gerais is a relatively recent republic, which needed a 13-year war against the Portuguese Empire and indirect help from Napoleon to be recognized, but in recent years its isolation and disagreements with the Empire of Brazil, its only neighbor , hampered the nation's development and caused a conflict that escalated into a second Inconfidência War. Will the republic regain its access to the Ocean and conquer better areas to produce food? Or will it suffer the same fate as other colonial revolutions and disappear?" #NT!
