 minas.10.f:0 "Oh, Minas Gerais
 Oh, Minas Gerais
 who knows you
 never forget
  
 Thy lands that are lofty
 Your sky is pure indigo
 You are beautiful, oh mining land
 Hope of our Country
 Your moon is the silverest
 That lights up our torrão
 You are beautiful, O enchanted land
 You are the pride of our nation
 Your streams adorn it with gold
 Your rivers carry diamonds
 That sparkle stars of dawn
 Between forests and giant cliffs
 Your mountains are made of iron
 That rise from the homeland of the cliffs
 In your airs, serenades sigh
 You are the altar of this immense country"
